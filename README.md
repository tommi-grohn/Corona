# Corona


There is a jupyter file 'vayla_traffic_analysis.ipynb' which reads all the files in the folder 'Vayla_data_modified_to_csv' and creates a csv file 'df_vayla_traffic.csv'.
There are some time series plotted in the file 'vayla_traffic_analysis.ipynb' to show the idea of this created csv file.


Soon I will update a new version of the Google's traffic data analysis. 
For now, old files I added during summer are in a folder 'old_files'.
