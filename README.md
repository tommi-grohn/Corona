DATA_CLEANING_2.ipynb
- Reads Väylä's traffic data
- Creates a file 'df_vayla_traffic.csv' in the folder 'Fully_implemented_dataframes' from the cleaned data. Indeed, DATA_CLEANING_2.ipynb doesn't need to be run!


DATA_CLEANING_3.ipynb
- Reads HSL's bike traffic data
- Creates a file 'df_hsl_traffic.csv' in the folder 'Fully_implemented_dataframes' from the cleaned data. Indeed, DATA_CLEANING_3.ipynb doesn't need to be run!



I will clean the MAIN_NOTEBOOK and DATA_CLEANING_1 in the following days.
